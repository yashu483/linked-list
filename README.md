# Project Linked List

## Introduction:

This repository contains solution of a project where we had to create a Linked List using the knowledge we have acquired from lessons on Data Structures and Algorithm, and Efficiency of Algorithms in the TOP curriculum.

## Guide:

- a new Linked List can be creates using LinkedList() constructor. This can be tested in devtool console.
- a linked list can have the following methods
  - append(value) -> adds a new node at last of the linked list
  - prepend(value) -> adds a new node at the start of the linked list
  - size -> an accessor property which returns size of the linked list
  - head -> returns head node
  - tail -> returns tail node
  - at(index) -> returns the node at the given index
  - pop() -> removes the last element from the list
  - contains(value) -> returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
  - find(value) -> returns the index of the node containing value, or null if not found.
  - toString() -> represents your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> null
  - insertAt(value, index) -> inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.
  - removeAt(index) -> removes the node at the given index.
